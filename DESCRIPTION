Title: Batch Request OTP from R
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Nathaniel A. Dewey <ndewey1@jhu.edu>
Maintainer: Nathaniel A. Dewey <ndewey1@jhu.edu>
Description: This package contains tools for interfacing with an OpenTripPlanner (OTP) server from R.
    The main tool sends a batch request (templated python script) to the OTP server REST path /otp/scripting/run and fetches the data returned.
    Other tools support the parameterization of this script, e.g., creating a grid of points, and support the setup of the OTP server, e.g. loading a router.
